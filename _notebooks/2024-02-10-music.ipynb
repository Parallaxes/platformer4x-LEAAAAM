    "\n",
    "Most of this capability comes from `GameEnv.js` with these static methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "// ~/assets/js/platformer/GameEnv.js\n",
    "// Play a sound by its ID\n",
    "static playSound(id) {\n",
    "    const sound = document.getElementById(id);\n",
    "    sound.play();\n",
    "}\n",

    "    const sound = document.getElementById(id);\n",
    "    sound.loop = true;\n",
    "    sound.play();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Stop all sounds\n",
    "static stopAllSounds() {\n",
    "    const sounds = document.getElementsByTagName('audio');\n",
    "    for (let sound of sounds) {\n",
    "        sound.pause();\n",
    "        sound.currentTime = 0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote the bottom two methods if you're curious. Anyway, I noticed that sound is played by its \"ID\". Well, what the heck is the id and why is it loaded from HTML (notice the `document.GetElementByID`). Took me a but longer than I should, but these IDs are loaded into HTML itself in `index.md`:\n",

    "Ok, what does that do? Well, it loads a file from the filepath `{{site.baseurl}}/assets/audio/evelong.mp3` and assigns it the id `everlong`. Boom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to play it on levels, I had to do a bit of a workaround. I didn't know where to load it to be unique to levels, so in a VERY jank workaround, I played it in upon loading the background.... Yeah not the best practice, but who'll know?\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "// ~/assets/js/platformer/BackgroundSnow.js\n",
